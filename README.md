# Hierarchical Risk Parity and Shrinkage Risk Parity Portfolio Optimization

This project focuses on implementing and comparing two portfolio optimization methods: Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) and Shrinkage Risk Parity (SRP).

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to develop and evaluate HRP and SRP models for asset allocation using historical ETF data.

## Methods

### Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP)
HRP uses hierarchical clustering to construct a diversified portfolio by avoiding concentration in correlated assets.

### Shrinkage Risk Parity (SRP)
SRP combines risk parity with shrinkage techniques to improve the stability of the covariance matrix estimation.

## Data

The project uses ETF data (`etf_data.csv`) containing historical prices and other relevant financial information.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fosh-pse/CPF_Final-Project_Seungeun-Park.git
   cd CPF_Final-Project_Seungeun-Park
   ```

2. **Run Jupyter Notebook**:
   Open `HRP_SRP_Comparison.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab to execute the code and see the results.

## Results

The results section includes a detailed comparison of HRP and SRP models based on their performance metrics from backtesting.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of HRP and SRP models in portfolio optimization. The detailed analysis and backtesting results provide insights into the strengths and limitations of each method.
